Mac OS has the worst UX design.
Use Synergy + remap Ctrl and Cmd in setting + remap Ctrl and Cmd in iterm2.
Use Alt-tab with search (beta build).
Keycastr, Maccy, Rectangle make Mac OS half usable.

Replace nvim with helix, ranger with nnn and zsh with fish + fzf. Because who can bother to remember configs? 0-config with sane defaults is the future.
 
Use n (function in fish) to invoke nnn with auto-dir entry disabled and cd on quit. Run "open" to open in Finder. I also made F2 in finder open iterm2.

Check `bind | rg fzf`  to see the binding in fish with fzf. Fish does not allow auto-completing hidden files (stubborn author). So fzf is the next best.

Helix is awesome. `clipboard-yank` is nice.

Remember that for reverse search to work in LyX we need to start lyxserver by specifying lyxpipe in path preferences.
